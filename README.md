# Farm idle prototype

## About

It is an Unity 3D prototype for Android devices. 

**Status of project:** unfinished! No further development planned.

### The main goal of the prototype

I did this project as a test task in one of the game studios. The main task was to assemble a prototype with the mechanics of collecting and selling wheat. In this project, I first used [Dotween](http://dotween.demigiant.com) package to harvest wheat animation and coins animation.

In this prototype, I made several mistakes. Firstly, visually the project was based on free assets and the colors and lighting were done poorly. The architecture of the project is also poorly done and several critical errors were made in the code. There is also a problem with layers of animations.

I didnâ€™t get an offer from the employer, but this prototype taught me a lot
